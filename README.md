8 tile problem using IDS (iterative deepening search)

8 tile problem is a famous problem in artificial intelligence (AI). In this problem, a 3x3 grid is given containing the numbers 1-8 and a blank tile. There are specific rules to move a blank tile and only operation available is to swap the blank tile with any of it's 4 possible neighbours.

We have to find sequence of actions performed on the blank tile so as to get a sorted form as follows:-
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 'B'
Here 'B' depicts the blank tile.

This program solves this problem using iterative deepening seach technique. FOr more information, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search.
